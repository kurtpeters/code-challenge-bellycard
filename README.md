Belly Inc. Coding Challenge
===========================

### Challenge 1: JavaScript Math Game

Using Node.js with Socket.IO build a math trivia game. The game should allow for one or more players from multiple locations to participate. A question should appear on the screen, and the first player to submit the correct answer should be awarded points. Anyone can join and leave the room.

The game should be versioned on GitHub, hosted on NodeJitsu, and backed by solid tests.

Take as much time as you need, ask as many questions as youâ€™d like, and be as creative as you can. Most importantly, have fun with it!
